# FIFA-Dream-Team

What makes a successful soccer dream team?

This is not a simple question and the answer probably depends on many factors and variables. Some may be as logical as the individual performance of the players, but this does not ensure the success of the team. 
A clear example of the above is the Paris Saint German squad, which despite being one of the most expensive teams and with the best players, has not yet achieved a Champions League championship.

There can probably be other important factors such as the connection and communication that the players have with each other, the strategies used by the coach and even financial constraints. Despite the above, the proposed optimization model focuses on a quantitative analysis that chooses the players with the best individual performance to maximize the overall performance of the team subject to multiple constraints.

In this project you will see how optimization can help build the Dream Team in FIFA 2022. Check the Jupyter Notebook for more!
